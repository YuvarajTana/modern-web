### SOLID principles (Object-Oriented Programming)

  1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 
    **Principle** : It is a fundamental concept in software design that advises a class or module to have only one primary reason to change, or in another words olny one responsibility.

    **Benfits** : Improves code focus, redability, simplifies debugging and enhances understanding
    
    Facilitates future enhancements without rewriting existing code
  2. Open Closed Principle (OCP) 
    **Principle** : Software entities(Class,module) should open for extension but closed for modification.

    **Benfits** : Facilitates future enhancements without rewritting existing code.

    
  3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 
    — child classes must be able to replace their super classes.
    
  4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 
    — interfaces should be small: classes should not implement unnecessary methods.
    
  5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 
    — dependency is reversed: high level components are free of low-level components.
