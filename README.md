### SOLID principles
  1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 
    — class should do only one task.
  2. Open Closed Principle (OCP) 
    — class should be extended not modified.
  3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 
    — child classes must be able to replace their super classes.
  4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 
    — interfaces should be small: classes should not implement unnecessary methods.
  5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 
    — dependency is reversed: high level components are free of low-level components.

  - Composition 

### Web Specific(Core Fundamentals, Deep Understanding, Design, Implementation, and Architecture)
  
  **Variables**
  - Using var, let and const

  Examples:
    ```JavaScript
      var name = "Yuvaraj Tana" 
      // Varibales declared with var can be hoitsed and will have two scopes global and local 


       // Varibales declared with var can be hoitsed and will have two scopes global and local 
      let age = 20;
      

      const address = "Tirupati"; // The value and type of address can not be changed

      const 

    ```
  **Hoisting**
  - Hoisting is a concept or behavior in JavaScript where the declaration of a function, variable, or class goes to the top of the scope they were defined in.
