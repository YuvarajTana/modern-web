### SOLID principles
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 
  — class should do only one task.
2. Open Closed Principle (OCP) 
  — class should be extended not modified.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 
  — child classes must be able to replace their super classes.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 
  — interfaces should be small: classes should not implement unnecessary methods.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 
  — dependency is reversed: high level components are free of low-level components.
