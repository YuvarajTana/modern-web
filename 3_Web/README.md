## Building blocks of a web application
- There are a few things we need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

  **User Interface**
    - How users will consume and interact with your application.
  **Routing** 
    - How users navigate between different parts of your application.
  **Data Fetching** 
    - Where your data lives and how to get it.
  **Rendering** 
    - When and where you render static or dynamic content.
  **Integrations** 
    - What third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
  **Infrastructure** 
    - Where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
  **Performance** 
    - how to optimize your application for end-users.
  **Scalability** 
    - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
  **Developer Experience** 
    - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.
