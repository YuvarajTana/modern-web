<!-- Quick recap of, how Next.js application Works  -->
## What is and Why Next.Js
    - Next.js is React framework for building full-stack web applications 
    
    - React features to build user interfaces, and Next.js additonal features and optimzations. It also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling and more. 

    - This allows us to focus on building application rather spending time with configuration.

## Routing 
    - Next.js uses a file-system based router where folders are used to define routes.
    - Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment, to create nested route, we can nest folders inside each other
