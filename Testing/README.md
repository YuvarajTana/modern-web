## All about TDD development 

### Why you should test
  - Check whether an application behaves as expected 
  - It works as a safeguard against unwanted behaviour when we make changes. 
  - 

### We should follow test priority, why because  we can't test everything 

1. Critical features / Must have features 
2. Edge cases in above features 
3. Things which are easy to break

### Basic component testing:
  - User interactions
  - rendering and conditional rendering 
  - Hooks
  - Utility functions
